# A NoC-based Neural Network Implementation on FPGA
Neural Networks have traditionally been implemented in 'Software' for various Deep Learning applications. Now these implementations are heavily math-intensive and therefore tend to be slower. Hence, this 'Hardware' Implementation aims at making dedicated hardware for Neural Networks for improved throughput and processing.

-> This project aims at improving the existing Hardware using the concepts of Network on a Chip (NoC).

-> Aim is to use better and smart Routers and Routing techniques.
